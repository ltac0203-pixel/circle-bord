# Current Project Limitations and Notes

## Current Limitations
1. **No Backend API** - All data is client-side only (lost on page refresh)
2. **Demo Authentication** - Uses localStorage, accepts any email/password
3. **No Data Persistence** - Games and matches are stored in component state
4. **No Edit Functionality** - Games can only be added or deleted, not edited
5. **Basic Validation** - Only HTML5 form validation, no advanced validation
6. **Single Page Application** - No complex routing structure

## Architecture Notes
- **Single Component Logic**: Most business logic in Dashboard.tsx
- **Simple State Management**: No Redux/MobX, just useState hooks
- **Auth Context**: Only context used, for authentication state
- **Routing**: Basic routing with ProtectedRoute component

## Feature Implementation Status
✅ User registration and sign-in (demo mode)
✅ Game registration form
✅ Automatic matching algorithm
✅ Match notifications
✅ Sport filtering
✅ Delete games functionality
✅ Responsive design
❌ Data persistence/backend
❌ Edit game details
❌ User profiles
❌ Real authentication
❌ Email notifications
❌ Advanced search/filters

## Development Environment
- Windows system (Git Bash available)
- Node.js with npm
- Visual Studio Code recommended
- Chrome DevTools for debugging

## Testing Coverage
- Minimal test coverage currently
- Only basic App.test.tsx exists
- Testing setup ready with Jest + React Testing Library

## Future Considerations
- Would benefit from backend API integration
- Consider adding state management for complex features
- Database integration for persistence
- Real authentication system
- WebSocket for real-time matching notifications
